                    <h2 id="about" >About Me</h2>
                    <p class="content">Ever since I was a small child I loved taking stuff apart figuring out how it works and then putting it back together, or at least attempt to. When I was first introduced to computers I couldn't fathom how they worked. That curiosity never faded and is still with me today. I've always enjoyed learning more about computers and technology and I get excited when I discover new solutions. I love that I will never be able to know everything, that there will always be something new for me to learn.  
                    <br> <br>
                    Before going to Loras College to study Computer Science I was in the Army for about 6 years. My time in the Army is what really solidified my career in technology. It wasn't until I took my first programming course at Loras that I realized I wanted to code. Up to that point I figured my career would consist of similar work that I did in the Army. However, my childhood dream of being an inventor was rekindled once I discovered coding. It was like playing with legos, and I realized I could invent and create just about anything with code. My favorite thing about coding is the feeling I get when I finally solve a challenge that has stumped me. Whether it's a bug in the code or creating a tricky function or algorithm.
                    
                        <br> <br>
                    I value honesty, loyalty, integrity, and respect above all else and I try my best to always live by those values.
                        <br> <br>
                    Outside of work I enjoy board games, video games, anime, hiking, snowboarding, traveling, and hanging out with friends.

                        This project was primarly to introduce myself to Unity and C#. 
                        I created a version of the game known as Mastermind, except I decided to keep the game text based.
                        The game generates a 4 letter code and ther player has a limited number of attempts to guess it correctly.
                        After each guess the player is given a hint about the correctness of their guess.

                        The program is almost a exact copy of the original game with one or two difference. 
                        This project was originally done in C++ utilizing the console for display and interaction. 
                        After learning JavaScript better I though I would be fun to rebuild the game with an actual GUI. 
                        The program works and a full game can be played, however it still could use much more debugging and updates.

                        This project was my senior capstone project at Loras College. 
                        The school's Planetarium needed a reservation system for showings. 
                        My team and I took on the task of creating a ticketing website where patrons could see upcoming showings, 
                        make reservations, and receive ticket stubs. 
                        Additionally the site needed to meet the needs of the faculty and staff that run and maintain the Planetarium. 
                        So a non-public management side of the site was also created so faculty could adjust all public facing content easily.
